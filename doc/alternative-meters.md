## Alternative Meters

I didn't choose any of these, but they might be suitable for other projects.

* **Badger** is a popular brand, made in Nogales, for example the Recordall
Model 25, but I can't figure out if they are NSF61-certified lead-free or not.
There are also nylon ones, but I'm skeptical of nylon.  And there's an
ultrasonic model, which has some obfuscated protocol, a windows app, etc,
none of which seems good.

* **Honeywell** makes great water meters but doesn't sell direct.

* **Seametrics** seems to make unremarkable meters, seems expensive for what it is.

* **McCrometer** makes the wrong kind of meter.

* **Itron** seems not to sell direct.

* **Master Meter** makes several types of meter, but seems to sell to utilities
only, and I can't find them on ebay etc.

* **Pulsafeeder/Pulsatron** used to make meters, but I can't find them anymore.

* **[RG3](https://rg3meter.com/water-meters/)** makes unremarkable meters

* **[Carlon](http://www.carlonmeter.com/products/industrial-meters-controls/jlp-series-meter)**
makes, or sells, I can't tell, meters that seem expensive and unremarkable.

* **Seeed Studio** sells pelton wheel and axial flow sensors
([example](https://www.seeedstudio.com/G1-Water-Flow-Sensor-p-1671.html))
that seem like hobbyist project material, rather than "real" meters,
and the large one that seems appropriate is out of stock.

* **Jerman** has a [fantastic web site](http://watermeters.com) but I couldn't
figure out which models were lead-free, and they seem less popular than
the Neptune I ended up with.

* **Next Century** make [this](http://docs.nextcenturymeters.com/NextCentury-M201C-Meter-Specification-Sheet.pdf)
but it's rated as "indoor only," and Next Century themselves seem more
concerned with software than hardware.

* **[Zenner](http://www.zennerusa.com/index.php?id_category=3&controller=category)**
seems to make unremarkable meters.

* **Clark** seem like a reseller? [Example](https://www.freshwatersystems.com/products/clark-clxc-p-series-single-jet-totalizing-water-meter-5-8-x-3-4-1-pulse-per-10-gal)

* **[Ferguson](https://www.ferguson.com/category/meters/water-meters/_/N-zbqkmu)** is a good local retailer.

* **Sensus** make an oscillating piston model which is
[available locally at Ferguson,](https://api.ferguson.com/dar-step-service/Query?ASSET_ID=2332410&USE_TYPE=SPECIFICATION&PRODUCT_ID=4707281)
but it's $170, much more than the Neptune.

* **EKM** make, or resell, a [stainless high-resolutoin meter](https://www.ekmmetering.com/collections/water-meters/products/3-4-water-meter-stainless-steel-high-definition-pulse-output) 
which is $140, much more than the Neptune, and not NSF approved.  Also EKM
seems more interested in software than hardware.

* **Assured Automation** is a fantastic reseller through [Flows.com](flows.com,) with many
options, e.g. [plastic](https://www.flows.com/economy-plastic-water-meter-wm-pc-series/)
and [brass](https://www.flows.com/lead-free-brass-water-meter-wm-nlc-series/)
and the [next century](https://www.flows.com/multi-jet-hot-and-cold-water-meter-3-4-economy-series/)
one, but all are more expensive than the Neptune, and all seem identical to
Dwyer, which sells direct.

* **[NMT](http://watermetergasmeter.com/watermeters.htm)** make plastic and bronze
meters in China, available on Amazon and ebay, but they're much less common
than the Neptune.

* **[DAE](https://daecontrol.com/product/dae-mj-75a-lead-free-potable-water-meter-3-4-npt-couplings-pulse-output-gallon/)**
make meters in Taiwan, and markets aggressively on Amazon, but they
seem more interested in IT than meters per se, and the Neptune is
still cheaper, and much more popular.

* **Dwyer** make meters in [China](https://www.dwyer-inst.com/PDF_files/C0339273%20-%20061.pdf)
and sell direct, for example the [WNT](https://www.dwyer-inst.com/PDF_files/PDS/DS_WNT.pdf)
model is NSF certified lead-free ecobrass, $97, which is still more expensive
and less popular than the Neptune.
